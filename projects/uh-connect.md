UH Connect is a group project assigned as our final project for our software development course: ICS 314. During my involvement with the UH-Connect project, I had the opportunity to gain valuable insights into the world of software engineering and web development. UH-Connect is my most recent and is one of the most complex projects I've worked on during college.

I was responsible for developing the student view, where students can access job listings and create or edit their profiles. This involved creating the profile editing page, which allows students to showcase their skills and qualifications to potential employers. Additionally, I worked on the company view, enabling companies to post job opportunities, view student profiles, and manage their candidate lists. This aspect of the project was critical in ensuring that both students and employers could easily connect. I also played a role in the admin view, ensuring that administrators had the necessary tools to oversee the platform's operations and ensure its smooth functioning.

Throughout my involvement in the UH-Connect project, I honed my skills in web development, particularly in React, which is the framework used for most of the app's components. This experience allowed me to become more proficient in building user-friendly interfaces. I gained practical experience with Git, MeteorJS, NodeJS, and Node Version Manager, which are essential tools for modern web development. Learning how to set up and manage these technologies was a valuable part of my journey.

Working on a project with multiple layers of technology, such as Meteor for the base code and Digital Ocean for hosting, gave me insights into how complex web applications are structured and deployed. Collaboration was a significant aspect of this project, and I learned how to work effectively as part of a team, ensuring that our contributions aligned with the project's overall goals and requirements.

In summary, my involvement in the UH-Connect project allowed me to take on meaningful responsibilities in the development of a platform that bridges the gap between students and employers. This experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also provided me with insights into project management, teamwork, and the practical aspects of web development.
