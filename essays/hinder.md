Modern-day classrooms, especially those in the field of Computer Science, often face challenges when it comes to fostering socialization among students. The prevailing stereotype of Computer Science students as "awkward" and "introverted" only exacerbates the issue, leading to a lack of meaningful connections within the academic community. The recent impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has further diminished students' social skills, making it imperative to address this challenge. In response to these concerns, we propose the development of a dedicated third-party application designed to enhance social interactions among Computer Science enthusiasts.

Computer Science students are, fundamentally, human beings who require socialization for personal and academic growth. Our solution is an innovative app—let's call it "Unhinder"— specifically tailored to the needs of Computer Science enthusiasts. Unlike generic social platforms, Unhinder will provide a niche space for students to connect with peers who share similar interests, creating a vibrant community within the realm of technology and beyond.

One of the distinctive features of Unhinder is its approach to matching users based on specific hobbies. Unlike conventional social apps, the hobbies section will delve deeper into the intricacies of shared interests, prompting users to specify their preferences within broader categories such as anime and video games. Going a step further, the app will prompt users to list their favorite games, whether it be League of Legends, Fortnite, or other popular titles. This level of specificity ensures that connections are not just superficial but rooted in genuine shared passions.

Unhinder’s user interface will be intuitive and user-friendly, making it accessible to individuals with varying levels of technological expertise. The app's design will prioritize clear categorization of hobbies and interests, facilitating seamless navigation and enhancing the overall user experience. 

In conclusion, Unhinder seeks to address the socialization challenges faced by Computer Science students by providing a dedicated platform for meaningful connections. By focusing on specific hobbies and interests, the app aims to break down barriers and create a space where individuals can engage with like-minded peers. As we navigate the ever-evolving landscape of education, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, fostering social connections within the Computer Science community becomes crucial. Unhinder stands as a potential solution to bridge the social gap, promoting collaboration, networking, and a sense of belonging among Computer Science enthusiasts.
