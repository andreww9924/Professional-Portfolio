Applied machine learning techniques to accurately identify and classify vehicles positioned at intersections. Generated diverse and representative datasets to serve as inputs for training the YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once) machine learning GitHub repository. Leveraged Python programming language to customize the YOLOv5 machine learning repository on GitHub, tailoring it to align with our unique requirements and objectives. Optimized the YOLOv5 model by fine-tuning hyperparameters and conducting rigorous testing, resulting in significantly improved accuracy and performance. Developed and crafted a professional website for the Hawaii LTAP (Local Technical Assistance Program), showcasing a user-friendly interface and engaging design. Conducted thorough research on previous projects undertaken by Hawaii LTAP (Local Technical Assistance Program) and appropriately documented them. Surveyed many users and gathered feedback on the Hawaii LTAP website, incorporating user suggestions to enhance usability and user experience."

      "summary": "Presented research on Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces to the Department of Defense. Collaborated closely with a select team of graduate students to conduct simulations of Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces. Consistently reached deadlines ahead of time with great teamwork. Utilized Python, Linux, and GNURadio to recreate and simulate MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) reflectors. Adapted MIMO to these affected reflecting surfaces to understand further and analyze 5G signals. Enhanced expertise in LabVIEW by designing comprehensive schematics for data measurement in a spectrum analyzer. Skillfully integrated Excel with LabVIEW to develop advanced features for recording results effectively. Utilized AutoCAD Fusion to design a series of 3D models, resulting in enhanced efficiency and organization for the physical setup. Demonstrated a proactive approach in consistently elevating the lab environment, achieving a more professional and visually appealing presentation. Updated our research group’s Github with new 3D models and codes."
