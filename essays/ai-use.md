Artificial Intelligence has become an integral part of modern education. Artificial intelligence can be a double-edged sword when it comes to learning computer science in a classroom setting. On one hand, it can act as a valuable assistant, providing insights, suggestions, and solutions to complex problems. On the other hand, there is a risk of over-reliance on AI, potentially hindering the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Throughout my semester taking ICS 314, I am no exception to using AI as a helpful tool. I have used AI to address syntax issues and enhance the quality of my code. One of the AI tools I frequently used was ChatGPT. It has been an incredibly useful tool when I struggled to find syntax errors or logical flaws in my code. Its ability to provide clear and concise explanations, along with code snippets, has helped me fix what seemed to be impossible-to-solve issues.

Moreover, ChatGPT has played a crucial role in enhancing my writing skills in the context of software engineering essays. It has an amazing tool in ensuring that my explanations are clear, concise, and free from grammatical errors. It also has helped me brainstorm ideas as well as further explain simple points. This has not only improved the readability of my work but has also improved the quality and content of my essays.

In summary, my personal experiences with AI tools like ChatGPT in ICS 314 have been largely positive. They have undoubtedly lessened the work load for me, and allowed me to focus on concepts instead of syntax. However, it is crucial to use AI tools conservatively and maintain a focus on developing problem-solving skills to ensure a well-rounded education in software engineering.
