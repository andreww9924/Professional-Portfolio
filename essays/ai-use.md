Artificial Intelligence has become an integral part of modern education. Artificial intelligence can be a double-edged sword when it comes to learning computer science in a classroom setting. On one hand, it can act as a valuable assistant, providing insights, suggestions, and solutions to complex problems. On the other hand, there is a risk of over-reliance on AI, potentially hindering the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Throughout my semester taking ICS 314, I am no exception to using AI as a helpful tool. I have used AI to address syntax issues and enhance the quality of my code. One of the AI tools I frequently used was ChatGPT. It has been an incredibly useful tool when I struggled to find syntax errors or logical flaws in my code. Its ability to provide clear and concise explanations, along with code snippets, has helped me fix what seemed to be impossible-to-solve issues.

Specifically, since our course allowed it, I’ve used ChatGPT to help fix syntax errors in our In-class practice and regular WODs. During these WODs, I would also ask it questions about concepts. Of course, I’ve also asked it to explain certain bits of codes as the course became more difficult and asked it for potential solutions to learn off of. An example of what I would ask would be something along the lines of “how would I use the .pluck function in underscore.” Because of how adaptable ChatGPT is, it has become a crucial tool for solving questions that could take hours to fix.

Besides just coding, I’ve used ChatGPT for essays and concepts as well. I’ve also used it to help give essay ideas as well as fixing simple grammar issues that I may have missed. For technical questions, I would ask ChatGPT before turning to the smart-questions section of the ICS 314 Discord server. 

Despite how useful ChatGPT is, I’ve never used AI for documentation or quality assurance. I have not tried to do either of these tasks with AI. I personally found ESLint to be easy to fix, so I didn’t need AI to fix it for me. Also, I believe documentation is quite easy to do, since it is just explaining the code in simple English. For those cases, I did not feel the need to use AI for help.

AI technologies, such as ChatGPT, has had a positive influenced my comprehension of software engineering concepts. It has helped me decipher complex syntax issues and generating clear, concise explanations, which has allowed a deeper understanding of programming principles. Additionally, AI-driven tools have helped complete various painful tasks, allowing me to allocate more time to problem-solving and critical thinking.

Outside of ICS 314, ChatGPT is used everywhere. Everyone I know uses ChatGPT in classes. Besides that, I know publishers of research papers also use ChatGPT. In those cases, AI becomes very troublesome. ChatGPT is an incredibly useful tool, but it becomes an issue when the highest tier of researchers try to use it to write their papers for them. Although seemingly effective in these cases, new technology has allowed detection of these generated papers. With technology like that available, we can assume that the  effectiveness of AI for generating essays will diminish overtime.

On that same topic, using ChatGPT comes with its challenges. ChatGPT is flawed in countless ways. It generates false information a lot of times. At times, it even messes up simple multiplication. Because of this, the challenge becomes realizing when the generation is incorrect. Thus, there are endless opportunities for the technology to advance. But, because of its flaws, ChatGPT will always be limited in its assistance in coursework.

Despite that negative note though, it is important to point out how much ChatGPT can teach us. Just like how google can give us questionable sources, it can also provide invaluable information. ChatGPT is the same, it answers questions that we would usually be stuck on for hours. In fact, I would argue that it teaches concepts better than a classroom setting. It can teach its users whatever they want to learn. It has worked incredibly well to explain concepts, and definitely helps engagement. It answers what we want to know and allows use to develop skills we wish to develop. However, it is meant to co-exist with a classroom setting. It is the classroom setting and management to assign valid learning goals. ChatGPT might be a great tool, but there needs to be a bridge for the users to seek that knowledge. That bridge should be the classroom and instructors. 

Many instructors fear this bridging of AI and classrooms. It is troublesome how easily students can cheat their way throughout a software engineering course. However, this should be an issue for the instructors. There are countless ways to co-exist with AI. It is on the instructors to adjust the course to match the future. Just like how math courses integrated calculators into their courses. It is very possible, and necessary, for Computer Science courses to integrate AI into their course agenda.

In summary, my personal experiences with AI tools like ChatGPT in ICS 314 have been largely positive. They have undoubtedly lessened the work load for me, and allowed me to focus on concepts instead of syntax. However, it is crucial to use AI tools conservatively and maintain a focus on developing problem-solving skills to ensure a well-rounded education in software engineering.
