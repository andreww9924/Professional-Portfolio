summary: "A personal project I made for daily use."

In college, I've done a couple of Arduino projects. These projects made me realize the potential Arduinos had.

One project I am very proud of is relatively simple. It is a Dance Dance Revolution pad powered by an Arduino.

This simple gamepad uses censors to go into multiple Arduino inputs to simulate the different arrows. By stepping on acrylic sheets,
we simulate the different directional arrows of DDR.

Although a simple project, it has become the only project I use on a bi-daily basis.
