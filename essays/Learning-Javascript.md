	From the perspective of a relatively experienced student in coding, I think Javascript is really straightforward. I’ve never used javascript before. Since we’ve just started using Javascript, I am still not sure how different this language would be, beyond syntax. Compared to Java, the syntax is a lot simpler. Compared to Python and C, the syntax is about equally as annoying to deal with. The rules are very similar to other programming languages, and it isn’t too hard to adjust.

	As mentioned before, I’ve had a decent amount of experience in the core aspects of coding. For ICS 314, we had to solve over 140 coding practice problems in the first week. From these modules, everything felt a bit repetitive. There were a couple of times when I had to stop and think about syntax when I got an error, but I didn’t have too many problems with the introduction section. However, for the module ES6, I had to think a lot harder about those problems. It was challenging but also fun. 

As for the style of learning, it felt too forced on content. There were too many problems for such a short amount of time. I didn’t have too many issues with it, but someone less experienced would struggle greatly with this. It wasn’t very enjoyable, because it felt really repetitive. A newer programmer would probably feel the same, with an extra layer of stress.

Despite the rushed amount of problems, Javascript is pretty fun. It feels rewarding to be able to solve the problems assigned so far. However, only time will tell if that rewarding feeling will require a lot more frustration.
