The Monet Project represents a significant and ongoing endeavor led by multiple distinguished professors. Its overarching objective is to develop adaptable and intelligent reflecting surfaces to serve the Department of Defense and NIWC.

I actively contributed to this project as a crucial part of both my EE396 and EE496 mandatory coursework at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. My mentor throughout this journey was Dr. Zheng, and my responsibilities varied depending on project needs. My involvement encompassed a wide range of tasks, including the physical design and fabrication of 3D models for our laboratory, for which I utilized Fusion software.

The project entailed rigorous signal analysis, involving the measurement of signal phase and magnitude. To achieve this, we employed a specialized testbed to generate and evaluate these critical values.

One of my key responsibilities involved the creation of LabVIEW schematics, which played an instrumental role in adjusting and fine-tuning a spectrum analyzer.

Participating in the Monet Project provided me with invaluable hands-on experience in various aspects of electrical engineering and research. I honed my skills in 3D modeling using Fusion, gained a deep understanding of signal analysis techniques, and became proficient in LabVIEW schematic design. Furthermore, I learned the importance of collaboration and adaptability in a long-term, multifaceted project. This experience has not only enhanced my technical abilities but also prepared me for future challenges in the field of electrical engineering and research.
