  <p>After a week of using ESLint and IntelliJ, I was reminded of the importance of “coding standards.” Coding standards are a set of rules that all programmers follow, even though they are often unwritten guidelines rather than explicit instructions. They provide a structured framework for writing code that is not only functional but also consistent and easy to understand.</p>

<p>My initial experience with ESLint and IntelliJ was marked by confusion as I encountered a barrage of warnings and errors. It felt overwhelming to see so many issues highlighted in my code. However, I soon realized that these warnings were not arbitrary; they were direct reflections of the coding standards I needed to adhere to.</p>

<p>As I delved deeper into the errors and warnings, I discovered that many of them revolved around a seemingly minor detail: the capitalization of the second words in function names. Initially, this might have seemed like a trivial matter, but it is a perfect example of the coding standards that developers are expected to follow.</p>

<p>In the world of coding standards, consistency is key. When all programmers follow the same naming conventions for functions, variables, and other elements of code, it becomes much easier to read and maintain the codebase. In my case, correcting the capitalization of function names not only eliminated the warnings but also made my code more readable and aligned with established best practices.</p>

<p>Moreover, these coding standards extend beyond mere aesthetics. They contribute to the overall quality of the code by promoting clarity, reducing the likelihood of bugs, and easing collaboration among team members. When everyone adheres to the same set of rules, it becomes easier to understand and work with each other’s code, regardless of who wrote it.</p>

<p>In conclusion, my initial confusion and frustration with ESLint and IntelliJ’s warnings served as a valuable reminder of the significance of coding standards in the world of programming. These standards may not always be explicitly written down, but they are essential for maintaining code quality, consistency, and readability. The experience of identifying and rectifying issues in my code reaffirmed the importance of adhering to these standards and striving for excellence in software development. It’s a journey that may have its challenges, but it’s one that ultimately leads to code that is not just functional but also of the highest quality.</p>
